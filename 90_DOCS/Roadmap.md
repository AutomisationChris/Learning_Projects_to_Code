# 🗺️ Project Roadmap

This document outlines the goals, milestones, and timeline for the project **"Learning Projects to Code"**.

## 🎯 Goals
- Build a practical, open-source coding learning environment.
- Explore APIs and real-world data integrations.
- Visualize data with Streamlit.
- Automate workflows and document progress dynamically on GitHub.
- Expand with engineering simulations (DWSIM, OpenFOAM, LTSpice).
- Apply Big Data handling techniques for large API datasets.
- Contribute to the open-source community.

## 📆 Timeline & Milestones

| Phase | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Phase 1 | Python Core + First APIs | ✅ Completed |
| Phase 2 | Streamlit Dashboards & API Combination | 🟢 In Progress |
| Phase 3 | Engineering Simulations & Environmental Data | 🔜 Planned |
| Phase 4 | Big Data Integration & Automation | 🔜 Planned |
| Phase 5 | Community Contributions & Automation | 🔜 Planned |

## ✅ Ongoing
- Continuous updates of README.md, About_me.md, and documentation in `90_DOCS`.
