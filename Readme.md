# Learning Projects to Code 🚀

> **Step in with me, a middle-aged nerd, on the discovery of coding.  
> A journey through bits and bytes to see how the world is programmed.  
> With various projects to learn Python, explore APIs, and build real applications.  
> Maybe some projects to contribute to the community and some nerdy things like audio & data visualization.**

## 📚 About this Repository

This is my personal coding playground to learn and document my journey through programming.
The goal is to build practical, working projects based on public APIs, Python, Streamlit, and GUI tools like Tkinter.  
Additionally, I explore open government data and visualize insights.

This repository will grow dynamically as I learn — the learning plan, projects, and API overview are continuously updated!
