# ðŸš€ Learning Projects to Code

Welcome to my journey of discovery in coding!

Here you'll find a variety of projects and learning resources as I explore:
- Python basics and beyond
- Streamlit dashboards
- Open Source simulations (DWSIM, OpenFOAM, LTSpice)
- Environmental data with QGIS and APIs
- Big Data handling
- Python + Excel Automation
- And much more!

Every project is documented and designed to grow step by step.  
Join me as I learn, build, and share ðŸš€
