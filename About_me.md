# ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Step in with me on my discovery of coding.  
From Python basics to nerdy projects with APIs and Streamlit dashboards.  
Learning bit by bit, byte by byte.

ðŸš€ **Interests:**
- Engineering Simulations (DWSIM, LTSpice, OpenFOAM)
- Environmental Data & Mapping (QGIS + PyQGIS)
- Data Visualization (Streamlit, Matplotlib)
- Big Data Mining with Python
- Automation & Reporting with Excel
- Contributing to Open Source projects

ðŸ’¡ My goal is to build projects that help the community, fuel curiosity, and embrace open-source thinking!

Follow my progress here as I learn and build!
