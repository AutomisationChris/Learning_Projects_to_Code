# Tests ðŸ§ª

This folder contains test scripts to ensure the functionality and reliability of project components.

## Purpose

- Validate API responses and data integrity
- Test utility functions (e.g., date converters, data cleaners)
- Prepare for continuous integration (CI) workflows (optional)
- Maintain code quality and consistency

## Recommended Tools

- **unittest** â€” Pythonâ€™s built-in testing framework
- **pytest** â€” Advanced and flexible testing tool
- **flake8 / black** â€” Code formatting and linting (optional)

## Next Steps

- Create basic tests for API functions
- Test data cleaning and merging workflows
- Optionally integrate with GitHub Actions for automated testing
