# Core Learning 📚 — Fundamentals of Programming

Welcome to the Core Learning section of the project!  
This folder contains essential projects, exercises, and learning materials that cover the fundamentals of programming. From writing your first Python scripts to more advanced techniques like data analysis and API integration.

## Contents

- **Weather_Data/** — Analysis of historical weather data with visualization and API integration
- *(More topics will be added as we progress, such as "Basic Python Syntax", "Data Structures", etc.)*

## Learning Goals

- 🧩 Understand Python fundamentals
- 📊 Create basic data visualizations
- 🌐 Work with APIs and real-time data sources
- 📂 Structure projects for better maintainability

## Next Steps

- Expand the Weather Data project (add APIs, improve visualizations)
- Optional: Add Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory data analysis
- Optional: Prepare Streamlit dashboard for live demos
