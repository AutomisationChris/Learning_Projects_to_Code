# Machine Learning 🧠

This folder contains projects related to Machine Learning experiments and data science workflows.

The goal is to explore how predictive models can be trained on collected data to generate insights or forecasts.

## 🧩 Planned Projects

- Temperature trend prediction 🌡️
- Air quality classification 🌫️
- Clustering of transport data 🚆
- Weather event detection (rain, storms) 🌩️

## Tools & Libraries

- **Scikit-Learn** — Core ML library for training models
- **Pandas** — Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** — Visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebooks** — Prototyping and experimentation

## Next Steps

- Prepare clean datasets from API sources
- Experiment with regression models
- Evaluate models and refine
- Optional: Integrate models into Streamlit apps

## Links

- [Main Project Overview](../../README.md)
- [API Documentation](../../90_DOCS/APIs_Uebersicht.md)
- [Project Management](../../00_Project_Management/README.md)

## Notes

> Machine learning projects are optional but add powerful insights.  
> The goal is to make data not only visible, but also predictive!
