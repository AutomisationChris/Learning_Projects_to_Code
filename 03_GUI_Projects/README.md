# GUI Projects 🖥️

This folder contains graphical user interface (GUI) projects, primarily built with **Tkinter**.

The goal is to create interactive desktop applications for data entry, visualization, and API interactions.

## 🛠️ Planned Applications

- Weather App with Tkinter 🌦️
- API Integration GUI
- Simple Data Entry Forms
- Interactive Dashboards (Local)

## Tools & Libraries

- **Tkinter** — Python's standard GUI package
- **Pandas** — for data handling
- **Matplotlib** — for embedding plots
- **Requests** — for fetching API data

## Next Steps

- Create basic layout and windows
- Connect GUI to Python scripts
- Fetch and display data from APIs
- Optional: Add export options (CSV, PNG)

## Links

- [Main Project Overview](../../README.md)
- [API Documentation](../../90_DOCS/APIs_Uebersicht.md)
- [Streamlit Apps](../../05_Streamlit_Apps/README.md)

## Notes

> GUI projects are great for desktop environments and will complement the web apps built with Streamlit.
